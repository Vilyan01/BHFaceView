# BHFaceView

## Description

This sample uses the *OpenCV* framework to detect faces in a live video stream using your camera's phone. Probably best not to use this when you are in the middle of the woods by yourself at night and hear noises around you.

## Installation

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure CocoaPods is installed. Visit [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) for installation instructions.
2. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/Vilyan01/BHFaceView.git`
3. In your *Terminal* application, run `cd BHFaceView && pod install`. This will install the *OpenCV* framework.
4. Type `open BHFaceView.xcworkspace` to open the project.
5. Select your device and click run.

**Note:** This application will not function on simulator devices as it will need to access a device's camera to retrieve the stream.
